- **Flashcard Display:** Displays each word and its definition in a flashcard format.
- **Mark for Revision:** Allows you to mark words for later revision.
- **Review Marked Words:** Cycle through previously marked words for focused learning.
- **Offline Mode Handling:** Alerts users when they are offline.
- **Loading Indicator:** Displays a loading message while fetching data.
