### Demo

(_Replace `#` with the actual deployment URL once hosted._)

## Overview

2D Maze Game is a dynamic puzzle game where players navigate through a series of procedurally generated mazes. The goal is to reach the green endpoint while avoiding dead ends and navigating increasingly complex pathways. Progress through levels and challenge your puzzle-solving skills!

## Features

- Dynamic maze generation using recursive algorithms.
- Increasing difficulty with progressive levels (up to 5).
- Randomized dead ends and branching paths for added complexity.
- Smooth player controls (keyboard arrow keys).
- Real-time timer to track gameplay duration.
- Visually distinct start and goal positions.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Internet connection (optional, if using external libraries)

### Installation

To run the 2D Maze Game locally:

1. Clone or download the project files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2D-Maze-Game.git
   cd 2D-Maze-Game
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Usage

1. Start the game, and the first maze will appear.
2. Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to move the player (red circle).
3. Reach the green goal to progress to the next level.
4. Complete all 5 levels to win!

## How to Play

1. Navigate the maze using your arrow keys.
2. Find the green goal (endpoint) to proceed to the next level.
3. Avoid dead ends and backtrack if necessary to find the correct path.
4. Keep an eye on the timer and challenge yourself to improve your completion time.

## Game Logic

- Mazes are procedurally generated, ensuring unique layouts every time.
- The endpoint is always reachable, with randomized dead ends and side paths to increase complexity.
- Levels grow in size and difficulty, starting from a small maze in Level 1 and scaling up to larger mazes in Level 5.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by classic maze puzzles and procedural generation algorithms.
- Maze generation powered by recursive backtracking with added complexity.
